Letters
=======

A library that parses letter svg path info so that in can be used for drawing API and rendering letters as sentences it has some basic ability to color words based on sentences and includes a basic a-z hand created font, the code is developed in haxe it currently works well for Javascript target, should be suitable for extension to flash target and has some semi working Java implementation. It is designed more as a lite toolkit to hack on rather than a perfect framework. The current a-z letters were hand crafted in flash API and exported using an online as3 script and then the path data extracted for easy use.  It's quite a low level simple structure ideal for extending to your needs but quite basic DIY toolset. The code has rudimentary 2.5D support very very simple 3D. The code allows you to use your own vector hand hacked svg path font with Html Canvas ( or perhaps java graphics2d ) and might be a good starting point for creating lite weight inovative text effects.  I have no idea how it compares to other web font approaches.
